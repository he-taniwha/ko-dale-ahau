##### Nau mai - Welcome

You know that feeling where you discover something new and realising its potential, tryout new things with it? That intense interest and drive to see what it can do, what you can with it, and then your imagination runs away.  That moment when you contemplate the potential it has and the ideas of it's application, and you just want to explore and test and try it out.

That's me when I'm trying out something that I've found in the depths of Github or the like. Excited to load it up and happy to get it working. And even keener to show it off to someone else that know will appreciate the layers of implications.
These are the times and situations that I love about this industry of information, communication and technology. Sure, there are things to not like, but if I can help it, I will choose to concentrate on the things that I can change.

All of this curiosity and experimenting helps fuel my learning.

John Seely Brown once said, _"It really is the case that if you become skilled at tinkering, you begin to get a gut feeling for how systems work..."_

And I find that this is how I work also.
