##### A bit about me

Hi, my name is Dale, and I am systems engineer with a chronic tinkerer habbit.

In a previous life I was a OS X sysadmin, using Apple XSAN and rack mounted Mac Mini's (and some super of Xserves) to run web services and fileshares, and managed end user service provisioning using JAMF for the School of Education at Waikato. Right now I am a Linux Sysadmin in the Systems Team for Information Technology Services at the University of Waikato, where I am responsible for building application servers on RedHat Enterprise Linux 7/8.

I believe in following upstream, staying close to stock, and patching and security by default. I love automation and use Ansible playbooks where possible for consistent and repeatable builds, allowing more time to innovate and iterate. I enjoy solving architecture problems with efficient and simple solutions, while maintaining system health,visibility through monitoring and future proofing through infrastructure as code an Continual Improvement.

Although I feel as though I've joined the Devops party late, seeing the advantages of containerising some of my systems in my homelab has brought me around to utilising it in my solutions professionally. Microservices appeals to me for the same reason that DevOps, version control and automation appeals to me, _consistent and repeatable builds_.

I love OSS projects hosted on GitHub, 12yo+ whiskies, and listening to audiobooks. I dabable in networking, home automation, security and Site Reliabliity Engineering.
